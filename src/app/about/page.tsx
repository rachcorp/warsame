              <p>I am putting my name forward as a candidate for the Ontario Liberal Party nomination in Ottawa West-Nepean because I care deeply about Ontario&apos;s public education and healthcare systems.</p>
              
              <p>The next election isn&apos;t just about changing governments; it&apos;s about protecting the fundamental values of creating opportunities for all that define our province. I am running to give a voice to the thousands in our community who have been ignored and to present a vision for a stronger, more compassionate Ontario.</p>
              
              <h3 className="font-bold mt-4">Restoring and Defending Public Services</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Health Crisis:</strong> With 2.5 million Ontarians lacking a family doctor and the public health system stretched to its breaking point, the status quo under Doug Ford&apos;s government is unsustainable. As your Liberal candidate, I will be the voice that highlights the dangers of privatization and offers solutions to rebuild and expand the public healthcare system.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Education:</strong> The erosion of funding and support for Ontario&apos;s public schools under the Doug Ford Conservatives has put the system at risk. We Liberals have historically stood for equitable and high-quality public education, and as a candidate with a clear vision I can address the growing concerns about underfunding and privatization in education.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="font-bold mt-4">Challenging the Ford Government&apos;s Track Record</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Healthcare Privatization:</strong> Doug Ford&apos;s push for private clinics and services not only undermines the single-payer system but also increases wait times for public services by draining off healthcare workers. As your Liberal candidate I will challenge this narrative with evidence-based plans to expand access to care.</li>
                <li><strong>Cuts and Deficiencies:</strong> The Ford government&apos;s cuts to education and healthcare have left teachers, nurses, and other public sector workers overworked and undervalued. As a member of the Liberal team, I will promote the reversal of these cuts and I will put forward policies that prioritize the public good.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="font-bold mt-4">Offering a Vision of Hope and Renewal</h3>
              <p>As your Ontario Liberal candidate in OWN, I promote these bold plans:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Expand public healthcare (e.g., more nurse practitioners, increasing residency spots for family doctors, and incentivizing medical professionals to work in under-served areas).</li>
                <li>Strengthen public education by investing in schools, reducing class sizes, and supporting teachers and staff.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>By focusing on a forward-looking, hopeful message, we can re-energize voters.</p>

              <h3 className="font-bold mt-4">Uniting Progressives to Fight Privatization</h3>
              <p>I believe the Ford government&apos;s privatization agenda provides a rallying point to unite progressive voters, labour unions, healthcare advocates, educators, and others who are deeply concerned about the future of Ontario&apos;s public services. As your Liberal candidate, I can build this coalition and ensure a broad, united front against the Doug Ford Conservatives.</p>
