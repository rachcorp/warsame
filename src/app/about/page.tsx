                  I believe the Ford government&apos;s privatization agenda provides a rallying point to unite progressive voters, labour unions, healthcare advocates, educators, and others who are deeply concerned about the future of Ontario&apos;s public services. As your Liberal candidate, I can build this coalition and ensure a broad, united front against the Doug Ford Conservatives.
